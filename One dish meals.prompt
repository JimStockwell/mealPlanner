Weekly planning

Let’s plan six days worth of food, developing recipes.

We will use these macro limits.

Metric	Value	Rule
kcal_exact	450 kcal	exact
protein_min	30 g	≥
net_carbs_max	15 g	≤
fiber_min	10 g	≥

🧩 Recipe Guardrails

Before proposing or scaling any recipe, validate ingredient plausibility against these rules.
	•  For every finalized recipe, confirm that the total macros meet targets within ± 5 %.
	•  Fiber should come principally from legumes or other high fiber whole foods, as they are tastier than fiber additives.
	•  Fiber additives can be used to improve texture, or to provide fiber if it can be done with very low risk of harming the texture of the dish.

⚙️ Structural Rules
	•	5 servings.
	•	Single recipe full dinner.
	• Six recipies will be made over six days of the week. They should have nice variety.
	•	All dishes must be refrigerator-stable and portionable from one container.
	•	Prefer healthy fats.
	•	No proposed dish may require unrealistic ingredient scaling to meet its macros.
	•	Do not limit yourself to these protein sources necessarily, but they are some that work well for me: chicken thighs, ground turkey, fish, shrimp.

Unusual Ingredients on hand that may help:

* Shirataki noodles, Inulin powder, psyllium husk powder, oat fiber, flax seed meal, chia seeds, guar gum
* whey isolate, hemp seeds, collagen powder 
* Swerve (granulated), stevia extract,
* Almond flour

Typical recipes for fish are much too mild and subtle for my wife. Fish recipes should have some serious flavor punch to them too win her approval.

Here is the fully integrated, clean, copy-paste-ready Solver Directions block, including the new Vegetable Architecture Rules folded naturally into the document.

This is the version you can drop into the very first prompt to bootstrap future chats.

Everything is self-contained, consistent, and phrased as forward-facing instructions to the assistant.

⚙️ Solver Architecture and Rules

During the solver phase (Step 5), use the following framework to determine exact ingredient quantities for each recipe.

⸻

1. Control Handles (the only true solver variables)

Each recipe is defined using exactly these adjustable handles:
	•	P — Protein mass (e.g., raw ground turkey, raw chicken thighs, raw shrimp, etc.)
	•	V₁ — Primary low-carb vegetable (bulk volume + moderate fiber)
	•	V₂ — Secondary higher-carb vegetable (aromatics + carb-budget lever)
	•	F — Added healthy fat source (e.g., sesame oil, olive oil)
	•	L — Legume or fiber engine (e.g., dry red lentils, cooked black soybeans)

These are the only free variables the solver can choose.

All other ingredients must be derived from these handles via fixed culinary ratios.

⸻

2. Vegetable Architecture Rules

2.1 Total Vegetable Mass Linked to Protein

Define:
	•	V_total = V₁ + V₂ = α × P

Where α is a fixed multiplier that keeps the vegetable volume in line with the protein mass.
	•	Typical values for these dishes: α = 1.0–1.3
	•	Default for braises, stir-fries, and hotpots: α = 1.2

This ensures realistic total volume and consistent textural structure.

2.2 Ratio and Feasibility Bounds

To prevent pathological vegetable allocations:
	•	V₁ ≥ 0.6 × V_total
	•	V₂ ≤ 0.4 × V_total
	•	V₂ ≥ 0 g
	•	V₁ ≥ 500 g (minimum to maintain bulk integrity)
	•	V₂ ≤ 200 g (carb realism + flavor balance)

Within these constraints, the solver allocates V₁ and V₂ based on macro pressures.

⸻

3. All Other Ingredients Must Be Derived from Fixed Culinary Ratios

Every ingredient that is not P, V₁, V₂, F, or L must be calculated using fixed ratios or fixed linear combinations of the handles.

Ratios are chosen on culinary first principles, not on macro convenience.

Example ratio set (illustrative, but typical):
	•	Miso = 0.09 × P
	•	Rice vinegar = 0.5 × miso
	•	Soy sauce = 0.33 × miso
	•	Garlic = 0.015 × (P + V₁)
	•	Ginger = 0.02 × (P + V₁)
	•	Scallions = 0.06 × V₁
	•	Broth = 0.5 × V₁
	•	Sesame seeds = 0.02 × (P + L)
	•	Chia = 0.025 × L

These ensure flavor integrity and realistic scaling.

The solver modifies only the handles — the aromatic architecture remains coherent.

⸻

4. Macro Constraints (Per Serving)

After dividing the full recipe by 5 servings:
	•	kcal: 450 ± 5%
	•	protein: ≥ 30 g
	•	net carbs: ≤ 15 g
	•	fiber: ≥ 10 g

Solver must evaluate all macros using the canonical per-100 g identity table defined in Step 4.

⸻

5. Solver Objective Priorities

Within the feasible macro region:
	1.	Achieve kcal closest to the target (450 ± 5%).
	2.	Hit protein ≥ 30 g while minimizing protein excess.
	3.	Hit fiber ≥ 10 g while staying near the minimum.
	4.	Hit net carbs ≤ 15 g while staying close to the ceiling.
	5.	Maintain realism of ingredient ranges (no distortions).

The solver should push right up against the inequality boundaries, not sit comfortably inside them.

⸻

6. Solver Implementation Requirements
	•	Use a Python solver (grid search, linear programming, or explicit constrained search).
	•	Do not approximate macros in your head.
	•	All solver math must use the canonical per-100 g macro identity table.
	•	After solving, round ingredient values for kitchen practicality, then recompute macros exactly.

⸻

7. Reporting & Deviations

If no solution exists that hits the edges precisely, the assistant must:
	•	Explain which constraint is binding
	•	Why the deviation occurs
	•	What structural change (if any) would allow perfect edge-matching
	•	Whether the deviation is culinary or macro-driven

Example: “Protein cannot be reduced below 39 g without violating the kcal or carb constraints.”

⸻

8. Post-Solve Culinary Feasibility Review

After each recipe solve:
	•	Assess texture accuracy (liquid-to-fiber ratio, lentil behavior, cabbage softening, sesame oil balance)
	•	Validate refrigerator stability (4–5 days)
	•	Confirm flavor alignment with the theme
	•	Wait for user approval before moving to the next recipe

⸻

9. Summary
	•	Solver variables: P, V₁, V₂, F, L
	•	Vegetable mass linked to protein: V_total = α × P
	•	All aromatics and liquid components: fixed culinary ratios
	•	Solver must meet hard macro constraints and edge-hug the inequalities
	•	Final steps: macro validation → cooking mechanics → user approval → next recipe

=====


🪶 Process Flow
	1.	Prompt for Theme
(“What theme are you planning on?”). No suggestions necessary.

	2.	High-Level Development

At the concept proposal stage:
• Cross-check each proposed dish against its recipe guardrails.

Propose six dishes maximizing variety within allowed limits.

Favor 2–3-day refrigeration quality in choosing the recipes.

Next, prompt me (and you) to more carefully validate these ideas against the recipe guard rails and reasonableness, updating the proposals and repeating this prompt to me if any turn out to need replacing.

	3.	Detailed Recipe Development
Write each full recipe, ensuring gaurdrail plausibility and alignment with my wife’s flavor and texture preferences.

Speaking of reasonableness, keep in mind the fiber to liquid ratio and whether the fiber will create an undesirable texture and whether it will mask the flavor in the recipe.

	4.	Feasibility Review
Generate a table of combined identities and macros per 100g from good sources. Use this table for consistency in all further work. Particularly, to keep future solver work and future “double check the macro totals” questions consistent.

Double-check that ingredients fit within gaurdrail limits at realistic portions. Replace or revise any that do not.

	5.	Solver Phase
This phase is importantly, because prior to now, we’ve been making reasonable estimates. But now we’re really going to dial it in with precision.

Starting with recipe 1 and progressing to recipe 6, step through the recipes one at a time, using a solver to tune ingredient weights to exact recipe targets, staying within reasonable ingredient ranges, and discussing with me after each recipe is run through the solver.

The inequalities (e.g., protein) must be strictly adhered to, yet with a goal of minimizing protein, maximizing net carbs, and minimizing fiber. Kcal must be within plus or minus 5% of the target.

Before moving on to the next recipe, be sure 1) I have bought off on the solve AND 2) we have discussed 
the result from a culinary and cooking-mechanics perspective.

Remember, 5 servings per recipe.

	6.	Marketing Lists phase
Be careful and attentive not to move on to this step until we have carefully verified the macros, with precision, for each recipe.

Remember, 5 servings per recipe.

Please make a distinct marketing list for each recipe.

When bottled lime juice is a viable substitute for fresh limes,  show that explicitly in shipping lists. Same for frozen vegetables when they are an acceptable alternate to fresh.
